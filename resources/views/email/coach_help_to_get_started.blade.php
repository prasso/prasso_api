Hey!

We noticed you haven't added your team or setup your info page on Prasso since you signed up to coach here.

No worries, starting a new platform can be overwhelming - we get it ðŸ˜Š. 

Today, let's focus on setting up your info page. Here are the first steps to get you going without any hassle:
Navigate to the info page in the app or on our web site: https://api.prasso.io/user/profile
Customize your personal profile info - don't miss adding your blog / twitter / instagram / facebook. 
Add some before and after pics if you want, to enhance your story.

Please reach out to us if you have any questions.

The Prasso Team


P.S. We also want to invite you to join us for a free LIVE demo to see how other coaches use Prasso,
 and to get all of your questions answered.
