# Prasso 

Prasso is an open-source rapid prototyping and app development platform. It includes both a mobile app and an API backend site.

The Prasso API serves data and pages to the mobile app. It provides the backend that enables low-code assembly of functional web and mobile apps.

Key benefits of Prasso:

- Simplified app prototyping 
- Customization options
- Time savings compared to traditional development
- Robust and scalable Laravel API backend
- Easy integration with tools like Firebase
- Comprehensive documentation

Prasso allows you to quickly build a mobile app by configuring tabs in the admin that point to pages served by the Prasso API. This enables rapid validation and iteration on app ideas.
