in this current branch, I want to create a new laravel package called autoprohub and plug it in to work with the laravel site that is the base. help me out

I'll help you create a new Laravel package called "autoprohub" and integrate it with your existing Laravel application. Let's break this down into steps.

First, let me check the structure of your Laravel project to ensure we create the package in the right location.

Analyzed
~/Documents/GitHub/faxt/prasso/prasso_api
I see you have a packages directory which is perfect for local package development. Let's create the autoprohub package structure. I'll create the necessary files and directories for your package.

First, let's create the package directory structure:

Ran terminal command
~/Documents/GitHub/faxt/prasso/prasso_api
$ mkdir -p packages/autoprohub/src packages/autoprohub/config packages/autoprohub/database/migrations packages/autoprohub/resources/views

Now, I'll create the package's composer.json file:

ErrorCascade cannot access path in .gitignore or .codeiumignore: /Users/Bobbi/Documents/GitHub/faxt/prasso/prasso_api/packages/autoprohub/composer.json
I apologize for the error. Let me try a different approach by first creating a ServiceProvider for the package:

ErrorCascade cannot access path in .gitignore or .codeiumignore: /Users/Bobbi/Documents/GitHub/faxt/prasso/prasso_api/packages/autoprohub/src/AutoProHubServiceProvider.php
I see there might be some restrictions on accessing the packages directory. Let me explain what we need to do manually:

First, we need to create the following directory structure in your project:
Code
CopyInsert
packages/autoprohub/
├── src/
│   └── AutoProHubServiceProvider.php
├── config/
├── database/
│   └── migrations/
├── resources/
│   └── views/
└── composer.json
In the composer.json file of the package, you'll need to add:
Code
CopyInsert
{
    "name": "prasso/autoprohub",
    "description": "Auto Pro Hub package for Laravel",
    "type": "library",
    "license": "MIT",
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Prasso\\AutoProHub\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.1"
    },
    "extra": {
        "laravel": {
            "providers": [
                "Prasso\\AutoProHub\\AutoProHubServiceProvider"
            ]
        }
    }
}
Create AutoProHubServiceProvider.php in the src directory with:
Code
CopyInsert
<?php

namespace Prasso\AutoProHub;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AutoProHubServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        //
    }

    public function boot()
    {
        //
    }
}
After creating these files, you'll need to modify your main project's composer.json to add:
Code
CopyInsert
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "packages/autoprohub"
    }
]
Then run:
Code
CopyInsert
composer require prasso/autoprohub
Would you like me to help you create these files and make the necessary modifications? Please let me know if you need any clarification or have specific requirements for the package functionality.

Your modified files:
.gitignore
~/Documents/GitHub/faxt/prasso/prasso_api
+1
-1
Me
I removed packages from git ignore. please try again to create this code base

Great, now that packages directory is no longer in .gitignore, let's create the package structure.

First, I'll create the necessary directories and files for the package:

Ran terminal command
~/Documents/GitHub/faxt/prasso/prasso_api
$ mkdir -p packages/autoprohub/src packages/autoprohub/config packages/autoprohub/database/migrations packages/autoprohub/resources/views

Now, let's create the package's composer.json file:

Created
composer.json
+22
-0

Open diff
Now, let's create the Service Provider:

Created
AutoProHubServiceProvider.php
+38

Let's create a basic configuration file:

Let's create a routes file:

Created
web.php
+11

Open diff
Let's create a basic view:

Created

Open diff
Now, let's modify the main project's composer.json to include our local package. I'll check the current composer.json first:

Analyzed

composer.json:(1-51)
Now I'll edit the composer.json to add our new package:

Edited

Now that we have set up the basic package structure, let's install it using Composer:

Ran terminal command
~/Documents/GitHub/faxt/prasso/prasso_api
$ composer require prasso/autoprohub

I see we need to adjust the stability requirement. Let's modify the composer.json to allow dev-main packages:

Now let's try installing the package again:

Great! I've successfully created and installed the autoprohub package. Here's a summary of what has been set up:

Created the package structure:
packages/autoprohub/src/ - Main package source code
packages/autoprohub/config/ - Configuration files
packages/autoprohub/database/migrations/ - Database migrations
packages/autoprohub/resources/views/ - Blade views
Created essential package files:
composer.json - Package configuration and dependencies
AutoProHubServiceProvider.php - Service provider for the package
Basic configuration file
Initial routes and views
Integrated the package with the main Laravel application by:
Adding it to the main project's composer.json
Setting up proper autoloading
Registering the service provider
The package is now ready for development. You can start adding features by:

Creating models in packages/autoprohub/src/Models/
Adding controllers in packages/autoprohub/src/Http/Controllers/
Creating migrations in packages/autoprohub/database/migrations/
Adding views in packages/autoprohub/resources/views/
Would you like me to help you implement any specific features or functionality for the autoprohub package?
