tell me the best way to start a laravel package from scratch.
## reply:
Starting a Laravel package from scratch can seem daunting, but breaking it down into steps makes the process manageable. Here's a guide to help you create a Laravel package from scratch:

### 1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Ensure you have PHP, Composer, and Laravel installed.
   - Create a new directory for your package development. You can do this anywhere on your file system.

### 2. **Create the Package Directory Structure**
   In your package directory, you'll need to create the basic structure:
   ```
   your-package/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── YourPackageServiceProvider.php
   │   ├── Facades/
   │   ├── Http/
   │   ├── Models/
   │   ├── Commands/
   │   ├── config/
   │   ├── routes/
   │   └── views/
   ├── tests/
   ├── composer.json
   └── README.md
   ```

### 3. **Set Up `composer.json`**
   - Run `composer init` to create a basic `composer.json` file. Follow the prompts to fill in the package details.
   - Add the following sections if they aren't already included:

   ```json
   "autoload": {
       "psr-4": {
           "VendorName\\PackageName\\": "src/"
       }
   },
   "extra": {
       "laravel": {
           "providers": [
               "VendorName\\PackageName\\YourPackageServiceProvider"
           ],
           "aliases": {
               "PackageName": "VendorName\\PackageName\\Facades\\PackageName"
           }
       }
   },
   "require": {
       "php": "^8.0",
       "illuminate/support": "^9.0"
   }
   ```

### 4. **Create the Service Provider**
   - Inside `src/`, create `YourPackageServiceProvider.php`.
   - This service provider will be the entry point for your package:

   ```php
   namespace VendorName\PackageName;

   use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

   class YourPackageServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
   {
       public function boot()
       {
           // Load routes
           $this->loadRoutesFrom(__DIR__.'/routes/web.php');

           // Load views
           $this->loadViewsFrom(__DIR__.'/views', 'packagename');

           // Load migrations
           $this->loadMigrationsFrom(__DIR__.'/database/migrations');

           // Publish config file
           $this->publishes([
               __DIR__.'/config/packagename.php' => config_path('packagename.php'),
           ]);
       }

       public function register()
       {
           // Merge config
           $this->mergeConfigFrom(
               __DIR__.'/config/packagename.php', 'packagename'
           );
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Add Routes (Optional)**
   - If your package includes routes, create a `routes/web.php` file:

   ```php
   <?php

   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

   Route::get('package-test', function () {
       return 'Hello from the package!';
   });
   ```

### 6. **Create Config File (Optional)**
   - If your package requires configuration, create a `config/packagename.php` file:

   ```php
   <?php

   return [
       'option' => 'value',
   ];
   ```

### 7. **Create Facades (Optional)**
   - If your package includes a facade, create a `src/Facades/PackageName.php`:

   ```php
   namespace VendorName\PackageName\Facades;

   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade;

   class PackageName extends Facade
   {
       protected static function getFacadeAccessor()
       {
           return 'packagename';
       }
   }
   ```

### 8. **Test Your Package**
   - Create a `tests` directory to write tests for your package using PHPUnit.
   - Ensure your package works correctly by running tests and checking the integration.

### 9. **Publish Your Package**
   - After everything is set, you can publish your package on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository.
   - Tag your release using Git:
     ```bash
     git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First release"
     git push origin --tags
     ```
   - Submit your package to Packagist, which allows others to install it via Composer.

### 10. **Document Your Package**
   - Update your `README.md` file with clear instructions on how to install and use your package.
   - Include examples and details about configuration, usage, and any other necessary information.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create and publish a Laravel package from scratch. This process involves setting up a basic directory structure, writing the service provider, and optionally adding features like routes, config, and facades. Testing and documentation are also crucial for a successful package.
basically, the answer is to create your package as part of a Laravel application. so I'm setting this up


# Prasso_messaging
messaging functionality for Laravel 

To create the directory structure for your `Prasso_messaging` package after cloning the repository, you can use the following terminal commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the cloned repository directory
cd Prasso_messaging

# Create the 'src' directory and its subdirectories
mkdir -p src/Facades src/Http src/Models src/Commands src/config src/routes src/views

# Create the 'tests' directory
mkdir tests

# Create the 'composer.json' file
touch composer.json

# Create the 'MessagingServiceProvider.php' file inside the 'src' directory
touch src/MessagingServiceProvider.php
```

### Explanation of Commands:
- `cd Prasso_messaging`: Navigates to your package directory.
- `mkdir -p src/Facades src/Http src/Models src/Commands src/database src/config src/routes src/views`: Creates the `src` directory and its subdirectories in a single command.
- `mkdir tests`: Creates the `tests` directory.
- `touch composer.json`: Creates an empty `composer.json` file.
- `touch src/MessagingServiceProvider.php`: Creates an empty `MessagingServiceProvider.php` file inside the `src` directory.


second try
Certainly! Here are the terminal commands to create the directory structure you specified for the `Prasso_messaging` package. These commands assume that you have already cloned the repository and are working within the `Prasso_messaging` directory.

```bash
# Navigate to the package directory
cd Prasso_messaging

# Create the src directory and its subdirectories
mkdir -p src/Facades src/Http src/Models src/Commands src/config src/routes src/views

# Create the tests directory
mkdir tests

# Create the composer.json file
touch composer.json

# Create the ServiceProvider file
touch src/MessagingServiceProvider.php
```

After running these commands, your directory structure will be set up as follows:

```
Prasso_messaging/
├── src/
│   ├── YourPackageServiceProvider.php
│   ├── Facades/
│   ├── Http/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Commands/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── routes/
│   └── views/
├── tests/
├── composer.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

You can then proceed to edit the `composer.json` file and other files as needed for your package development.
