Here are the steps to make your project a Git repository and host it on GitHub:

Initialize a Git repository locally:
Navigate to your project directory
Run git init
Create a .gitignore file (optional but recommended):
Create a file named .gitignore in your project root
Add patterns for files/folders you don't want to track (like node_modules, build directories, etc.)
Add your files to Git:
Run git add . to stage all files (or selectively add files)
Run git commit -m "Initial commit" to commit them
Create a new repository on GitHub:
Go to https://github.com/new
Enter a repository name
Choose public or private
Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since you're pushing an existing repo)
Click "Create repository"
Connect your local repository to GitHub:
Copy the URL of your new GitHub repository
Run git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
Push your code to GitHub:
Run git push -u origin main (or git push -u origin master depending on your default branch name)
Verify that your code is now on GitHub by visiting the repository URL
That's it! Your project is now a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
