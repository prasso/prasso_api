**Updated With:**
- Reverse proxy architecture explanation
- Node.js server requirements
- Configuration with two fields: `pwa_app_url` and `pwa_server_url`
- Multiple apps on different ports example
- Troubleshooting for proxy connections

### 2. `pwa-implementation-complete.md` ✅ FIXED
**Invalid Details Removed:**
- Removed static file serving logic from index() method

- Removed deployment structure for static files

**Updated With:**
- `pwa_server_url` column documentation
- Proxy method documentation
- Request forwarding explanation
- Node.js server handling
- Multiple apps configuration

### 3. `pwa-site-serving-implementation.md` ✅ FIXED

- Removed multi-level file resolution examples
- Removed PWA fallback examples
- Updated masterpage check to require both `pwa_app_url` and `pwa_server_url`

**Updated With:**
- Proxy forwarding in request flow examples
- Node.js server processing
- Updated logging examples with proxy messages
- Correct masterpage handling logic

### 5. `pwa-implementation-summary.md` ✅ REVIEWED
**Status:** Already contains correct information about URL routing and DNS setup. No changes needed.

### 6. `pwa-testing-checklist.md` ✅ REVIEWED
**Status:** Already contains correct testing procedures for URL routing and page serving. No changes needed.

### 7. `pwa-reverse-proxy.md` ✅ REVIEWED
**Status:** Correct implementation guide for reverse proxy. No changes needed.

### 8. `PWA_REVERSE_PROXY_SUMMARY.md` ✅ REVIEWED
**Status:** Correct quick reference summary. No changes needed.

## Invalid Details Removed

1. ❌ Deployment to `public/hosted_pwa/{app_id}/`
2. ❌ Static file serving from public directory
3. ❌ Multi-level file resolution (exact file, .html, directory index)
4. ❌ PWA index.html fallback for SPA routing
5. ❌ Supported file types list
6. ❌ Build output deployment instructions
7. ❌ File permission checks

## Correct Details Added

1. ✅ `pwa_server_url` field for Node.js server URL
2. ✅ Reverse proxy forwarding logic
3. ✅ HTTP method preservation
4. ✅ Header forwarding (except Host, Connection, Content-Length)
5. ✅ Request body forwarding for POST/PUT/PATCH
6. ✅ Query string preservation
7. ✅ 30-second timeout for proxy requests
8. ✅ Error handling and fallback to Prasso pages
9. ✅ Multiple apps on different ports
10. ✅ Node.js server requirements

## Documentation Consistency

All PWA documentation now consistently describes:

- **URL Routing**: Site URLs first, PWA URLs second, 404 if neither
- **Configuration**: Two fields in app editor (PWA App URL + PWA Server URL)
- **Proxy Forwarding**: All requests forwarded to Node.js server
- **Error Handling**: Falls back to Prasso pages if proxy fails
- **Logging**: Proxy operation logging for debugging
- **Masterpage**: Skipped for PWA sites (when both fields are set)

## Files Needing No Changes

These files already contained correct information:

- `pwa-implementation-summary.md` - Covers URL routing and DNS setup correctly
- `pwa-testing-checklist.md` - Testing procedures are correct
- `pwa-reverse-proxy.md` - Complete reverse proxy guide
- `PWA_REVERSE_PROXY_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference summary
- `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES.md` - Documentation change log

## Verification

All documentation has been verified to:

✅ Remove static file serving references  
✅ Remove multi-level file resolution references  
✅ Remove PWA fallback references  
✅ Include `pwa_server_url` field  
✅ Describe reverse proxy forwarding  
✅ Include Node.js server configuration  
✅ Describe error handling and fallback  
✅ Include logging examples  
✅ Describe multiple apps setup  
✅ Maintain consistency across all docs  

## Next Steps

1. Review updated documentation
2. Verify all examples are accurate
3. Test reverse proxy implementation
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Monitor logs for proxy operations
