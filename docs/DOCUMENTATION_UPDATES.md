# Documentation Updates - PWA Site Serving Implementation

## Summary

This document tracks all documentation updates made to reflect the PWA site serving implementation with intelligent URL routing.

## Updated Documentation Files

### 1. `pwa-implementation-summary.md`
**Changes Made**:
- Added Section 7: "URL Routing for PWA Sites"
  - Documented `getClientFromHost()` method (Lines 103-136)
  - Documented `getMasterForSite()` method (Lines 138-169)
- Added Section 8: "PWA Page Serving"
  - Documented `index()` method (Lines 55-81)
  - Documented `viewSitePage()` method (Lines 374-408)
  - Documented `viewSitePage()` fallback (Lines 461-483)
- Updated "Files Modified" section to include:
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php`
  - `app/Http/Controllers/SitePageController.php`

**Purpose**: Provides comprehensive overview of all PWA implementation changes including routing.

### 2. `pwa-app-sites.md`
**Changes Made**:
- Added "URL Routing Priority" subsection under Configuration
- Explained the 3-step routing flow:
  1. Check if URL matches defined site host
  2. Check if URL matches PWA app URL
  3. Abort 404 if neither
- Provided examples of how routing works with different configurations

**Purpose**: User-facing documentation explaining how PWA sites are served and URL routing priority.

### 3. `pwa-testing-checklist.md`
**Changes Made**:
- Added Section 8: "URL Routing for PWA Sites"
  - Tests for site URL priority
  - Tests for PWA URL fallback
  - Tests for 404 handling
  - Tests for logging verification
- Added Section 9: "PWA Page Serving"
  - Tests for homepage serving
  - Tests for multi-level page resolution
  - Tests for PWA fallback (SPA routing)
  - Tests for masterpage skipping
  - Tests for logging verification
- Renumbered "Edge Cases" from Section 8 to Section 10

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing checklist for QA to verify all PWA routing functionality.
