# Getting Started

After registration, use the **site creation wizard** to make your site. This is the foundation for your apps.

- A site is identified by its **URL**.
- You can enable **user registration** and **sub-team data isolation** if needed.

Next, add **views** to your site using the **dashboard tools**. Use the **visual editor** or connect **existing URLs**.

## Building Mobile Apps

- Apps **associate** with sites. 
- Apps are configured with **tabs** pointing to site **views**.
- The app **host** identifies the site and tab data to load. This is sent back as **JSON** for the app to parse and display.
- Update tabs anytime through the **admin panel**. 

## Managing Users and Teams

- Users join **teams** associated with sites. They get access based on **role** (admin or user).
- **Admins** can set up apps for their sites through the admin panel.
- **Sub-teams** enable data isolation when configured. The main site team still has access.
